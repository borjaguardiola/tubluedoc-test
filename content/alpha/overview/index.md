# The BlueVia Voice API

With the release of the alpha BlueVia voice API, we are allowing you to embed voice functionality into your applications. BlueVia Voice APIs provide you Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that is so simple to use, allowing you to add complex voice functionality to your applications without any of the associated hassle. Think of the use case and within minutes you can prototype it, test it and deploy it. We manage all of the hard voice connectivity work on your behalf.

The launch of the BlueVia Voice APIs marks the first time that any mobile carrier has exposed their voice assets through a zero touch interface - that's right you don't need to fill out reams of documentation to play! Simply join the alpha, we will give you some numbers for free, and you can play within minutes! Have a look at the [BlueVia Voice API Quick Start Guide] [Quick Start Guide] to see how easy it is to play with our network. 

The following diagram provides a glipse of how we are providing access to the PSTN network from your application servers. Your Customers call your BlueVia Voice Numbers and we route the calls to you. You then tell us exactly what you would like to do with the calls via our [REST API][Overview REST API] or via [Call Commands][Overview Call Control]. Its simple!

It could not be easier to add voice functionality into your application using our APIs they are that simple to use. Here are the basics:

* [Configure your BlueVia Voice number] [Overview Configure]
* Call it. Of course to do something a little more advance please have a look at the [BlueVia Voice API Quick Start Guide] [Quick Start Guide] 

It's that simple. In fact during the alpha period we had made this even simpler by:

* Giving you numbers to play with, all you have to do is [Configure your BlueVia Voice number] [Overview Configure]
* We have also made **using these numbers free**, for the alpha period only. This will allow you to explore The BlueVia Voice API, completely free of charge. Once the alpha period is complete, inbound and outbound calls to BlueVia Voice numbers will be charged. See the [BlueVia Voice API pricing] [Overview Pricing] for further details on API usage charges. 
* **NOTE:** That outbound calls from your [BlueVia Voice numbers] [BlueVia Dashboard] to phones does have a cost. For all call pricing information, refer to the [BlueVia Voice API pricing] [Overview Pricing]. Also for information about adding balance to your account, such that you can make outbound calls, refer to the [Adding balance to your BlueVia account] [Overview Add Balance] section.

The BlueVia Voice API can be used in either of two ways (or a combination of both!). BlueVia Voice can be engaged via a [RESTful API] [API Reference] or via [Call Control Commands] [Command Reference] that you provide to BlueVia.
