# Differences Between Existing BlueVia API’s and the BlueVia Voice API


There are several key differences between the BlueVia Voice API and existing BlueVia APIs.

Firstly BlueVia Voice APIs are not restricted for consumption to just Telefonica customers, this means that any phone can be used by you to engage with your customers globally. The APIs are not restricted to only be used by Telefonica customers, and they are not restricted only by mobile customers.

We are working on providing access to the APIs to any internet connected device such as a tablet, smart TV or even an internet connected toaster. This functionality is not provided in our alpha release (please see our [BlueVia roadmap][RoadMap Introduction] for further detail about when VoIP functionality will be available).

Secondly, there is a cost associated with using the BlueVia Voice APIs. You can [add a cash balance to your account][Overview Add Balance] that will then provide you access to all of the features of the BlueVia Voice APIs. Charges will be made to access the following BlueVia voice functionality:

* Outbound calls from your BlueVia Numbers - outbound calls are charged based on the country you are calling. [The BlueVia Voice API Costs][Overview Pricing] outlines all of the associated charges that are made for outbound calls
* Inbound calls to your BlueVia Numbers. During the alpha period, there will be no charge for calls made to your BlueVia numbers. Post the alpha period the following [charges for inbound calls to BlueVia Numbers][Overview Pricing] will be applied.
* Monthly rental of BlueVia Numbers. Initially during the alpha period we will be giving developers BlueVia numbers in each of our launch territories. Once the alpha period finishes developers will be charged a [monthly fee for BlueVia numbers][Overview Pricing]. The monthly fee of a BlueVia number will vary based on the country that the number is sold in.

Thirdly, there is no revenue share business model, as there has been with previous BlueVia APIs. Usage of the APIs will be based on a Pay As You Go, PAYG, model. As described previously, you will add a balance to your account allowing you access to the BlueVia Voice API functionality. There is currently no business model, whereby the end Customer of your application pays for the usage of the APIs, as with the existing BlueVia APIs. Currently this model is not available as we wish to provide cross network mobile coverage, and indeed access to any phone globally.

There is of course no limitation as to how you pass on any associated cost of usage of the BlueVia voice API’s to your customers. In the future there will be the possibility of using the BlueVia Direct To Bill payments, in certain countries, which will allow you to pass on API costs to your end customers if you choose to. Direct to Bill payments are not available during out alpha phase, however please keep track of the [BlueVia roadmap][RoadMap Introduction] to see when this might be available, and in which countries. Of course Direct To Bill payments will only be available through BlueVia to Telefonica and Telenor customers.
