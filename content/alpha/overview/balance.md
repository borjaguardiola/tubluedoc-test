# Adding Balance To Your BlueVia Account

**NOTE** During the alpha period call charges will be free. There is no need to add credit to our account.

You can add balance to your BlueVia account via the [BlueVia dashboard][BlueVia Dashboard]. You have to be signed in to add balance to your account. If you haven't already you can [create your BlueVia Account][BlueVia Create Account] prior to adding balance. Payment can be made via credit card.

You are also able to set up an auto-topup through the payment pages, which will allow for the automatic addition of further balance to your account, should your balance fall below the specified threshold. Please note during the alpha period the balance threshold is fixed. Keep your eyes on the [BlueVia Roadmap][RoadMap] to see when you will be able to specify the balance topup threshold setting specific to your account.
