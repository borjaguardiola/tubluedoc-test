# Buying Numbers

Once you sign up for the BlueVia Voice API alpha we will give you 6 BlueVia Voice Numbers to use. We will provide you with 2 numbers in each of our alpha launch territories:

* The USA and Canada
* The United Kingdom and
* Germany

During the alpha period these numbers will be provided to you for free. Post the alpha release you will be charged a monthly rental for these numbers. The [Monthly cost for BlueVia Voice Numbers] [Overview Pricing] will be taken each month, for each of your numbers, from your balance.

Post the alpha period we will also be adding support for numbers in further territories. Again please refer to the [BlueVia Voice API product roadmap] [RoadMap Introduction] for an overview of the territories we will be deploying local numbers in.
