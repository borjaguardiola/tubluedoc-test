When numbers are available to purchase the Available Numbers Collection will provide a mechanism for you to access the details of numbers that are available to purchase. You will then be able to purchase these numbers, and add them to your account using the [Account Number Collections][URL_To_Account_Number_Collection] and [Account Numbers][URL_To_Account_Number]
