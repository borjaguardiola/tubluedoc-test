# RoadMap

BlueVia Voice APIs are by no means complete. The current release (February 2013) is an alpha release, and we are continuing to progress the product based on the existing product roadmap, and based on your feedback. If you have any feedback you wish to provide us please email the BlueVia team at <support@bluevia.com> or email me directly at <murray@bluevia.com>. We would love to hear your feedback, be it positive or negative. Obviously we will address the negative as quickly as possible, but we would also like to hear of any product ideas that you might have that we could incorporate for you, and other developers.

The following provides an overview of what we are currently working on for you. This is a tentative roadmap and will undoubtedly change. We will keep this section updated though, so you can see exactly what we are delivering for you. There are of course some things we cannot reveal right now, but rest assured that we are currently prototyping some ground breaking voice and SMS functionality, so make sure you check back for updates on this progress (when we can announce it ;-) ).

**Detail Coming Soon!**
